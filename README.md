# Digi-X-Lightning-Assessment

## This repo contains the solution for 2 tasks required by the Digi-X assessment. 

### Section 1 questions is answered seperatly in the " Section_1" repo.

### Section 2 questions is answered in .md file named "Section_2".

Section 1:
⋅⋅⋅ You are tasked to build a new product, an online restaurant reservation platform -
⋅⋅⋅ choose a front-end language/framework, back-end language/framework and a database
⋅⋅⋅ management system. Tell us why you’ve chosen this stack.

Section 2:
⋅⋅⋅ In the programming language of your choice, write the solution for the following
⋅⋅⋅ questions:
⋅⋅⋅ 1. Write a for loop that prints all the multiples of 3 and 5 up to 100:
⋅⋅⋅ a. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10...100
⋅⋅⋅ 2. The highest common factor of N numbers is the largest positive integer that
⋅⋅⋅ divides all numbers without giving a remainder. Write an algorithm to determine
⋅⋅⋅ the highest common factor of N positive integers.
⋅⋅⋅ Input
⋅⋅⋅ The input to the function / method consists of two arguments:
● num , an integer representing the number of positive integers (N)
● arr , a list of integers
● findHCF( num , arr ) → HCF
Output
Return an integer representing the highest common factor of the given positive
integers.
a. findHCF(5, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) → 2
b. findHCF(5, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) → 1
c. findHCF(3, [-3, -1, 1, 3, 21]) → 3
d. findHCF(4, [-1, 4, 48, 12, 8]) → 4
e. findHCF(1, [-1, -2, -3, -4, 21]) → 21
3. Write a function that detects whether a string is a palindrome:
a. ‘tacocat’ → true
b. ‘racecar’ → true
c. ‘beanbag’ → false
d. ‘Hannah’ → true
